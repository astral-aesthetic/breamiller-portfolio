    overview: "Opia is a digital art piece that explores one of language's most fascinating untranslatable concepts: the awareness of how little we understand about another's inner experience. The work poses a profound question: What if the most powerful messages were never spoken? Opia communicates beyond words through visual metaphor and emotional resonance, creating a visual representation of unspoken communication. By dwelling in the spaces between words, Opia invites viewers to recognize the profound depths of human connection that exist beyond language—in silence, gesture, presence, and the mysterious opia that connects all conscious beings.",

    overview: "Ethereal Stroll is an ambient composition that serves as a sonic sanctuary for meditation, relaxation, and spiritual exploration. The work creates a landscape of flowing textures, subtle tonal shifts, and spacious silence—a soundscape that supports deep introspection and presence. By embracing simplicity and negative space, Ethereal Stroll invites listeners into a state of receptivity where the mind can settle, the heart can open, and consciousness can expand. Perfect for yoga, meditation, sleep, or contemplative work, this composition becomes a journey of turning inward.",
